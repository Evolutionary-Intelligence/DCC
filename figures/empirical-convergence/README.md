Here a total of six figures show (more or less) **empirical evidences** of DCC's global convergence on these six different benchmarks functions, very common in the evolutionary computation community. Note that strong empirical evidences do not necessarily mean solid theoretical conclusions. For rigorous theoretical conclusions, typically **mathematical proofs** are further needed. Please refer to our paper for detailed mathematical proofs on most of these chosen functions.
