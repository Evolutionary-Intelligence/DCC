# README

All code is based on our recently developed optimization library **[PyPop7](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/pypop)**, which is now activaly updated. Our current Python implementation for **DCC** depends only on [NumPy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2), [SciPy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0686-2), and [Ray](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18/presentation/moritz).
